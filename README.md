This is a proof of concept project which will be utilized in a future project.
The essential premise is to make a program in which a user can create a melody without any prior music experience.
Using math and music theory a user can turn a few notes into a multi-measure melody in a key chosen from the notes entered.
The python program will play the midi file and create sheet music for the melody as well.
